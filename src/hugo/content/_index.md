This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Anake theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) through [Github Actions](https://github.com/chabad360/hugo-gh-pages).

It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the source is available [here](https://github.com/EricStG/esg.dev).

I'm still playing around with things so don't be surprised if anything changes drastically

I'm planning to use this space to share thoughts, ideas and stories about my adventures in software development.

And possibly curling ðŸ¥Œ

See [About]({{< ref "about" >}}) for more information about me.
