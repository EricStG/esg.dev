Just another developer.

With *opinions*.

I spend my spare times pretending to know how to slide pieces of granite over sheets of ice ðŸ¥Œ

I'm planning to use this space to share thoughts, ideas and stories about my adventures in software developement.

And possibly curling ðŸ¥Œ

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Anake theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) through [Azure Devops](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/devops/).

It is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and the infrastructure is managed through [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Overkill much? You betcha!

I'm stil playing around with things so don't be surprised if anything changes drastically
